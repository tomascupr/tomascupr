# 👋 Ahoy, I’m **Tomas Cupr**

Serial founder — **Slevomat → Dáme Jídlo → Rohlik Group** — now exploring the edge where autonomous software writes, ships and grows itself.

## 🚀 What keeps me up at night
- **Building tools for autonomous AI agent creation and management at scale.**
- **Agentic engineering**: cultivating a 100 % AI software team that ideates, codes, tests, deploys and continuously retrains itself.
- **Meta‑productivity loops**: letting AI agents build better AI agents (and the infra that supports them) every sprint.
- **Making life easier**: whether it’s daily‑deal bargains, hot meals on demand or same‑day groceries, the goal is fewer errands and more living.

🙋 Humans still have seats at the table — mostly to ask better questions and unplug things when they catch fire.

## 💻 About this GitHub
It’s **vibecoding** central: half‑baked prototypes, weekend spikes, and occasional production‑ready gems. Expect TODOs, 🤯 moments and pull requests from silicon teammates.
